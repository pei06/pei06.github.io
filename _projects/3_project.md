The design and evaluation of the infant Cardiac Robotic Surgical System (iCROSS) was the primary research project in which I was involved during my undergraduate years. This research focuses on developing a dual-arm surgical robot system to assist infant PDA closure through teleoperation, including mechatronics, system integration, and mechanical and software design. I was responsible for the software of this robotic system which mainly included the following tasks: designing and implementing a software structure that manages joystick-based human-robot interaction and detects self-collision of the surgical robot.
