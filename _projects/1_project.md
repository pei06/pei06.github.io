 We wanted to make a robot arm to draw a image on a plane with any angle. We first applied Canny edge detection algorithm to obtain image contours. Then we formulated a trajectory‑forming algorithm to decide the trajectories to draw an image given the contours. At last we tested our work using a Snoopy image. The TM5-900 manipulator successfully drew the image on an inclined plane.
