 This project aims to control a robot arm to draw on an arbitrary plane. The following tasks were crucial to achieving the goal: image processing, trajectory formulation, and visual pose estimation. We applied the Canny Edge Detection algorithm to obtain image contours. Then we developed a trajectoryâ€‘forming algorithm to decide the trajectories given the contours. By solving the Perspective-n-Points problem, we can estimate the 3D pose using 2D images on the plane. We tested our work using a Snoopy image, and the TM5-900 manipulator successfully drew the image on an inclined plane.
