  title={Online Adaptation for Flying Quadrotors in Tight Formations},
  author={Hsieh, Pei-An and Chee, Kong Yao and Hsieh, M. Ani},
  abstract={The task of flying in tight formations is challenging for teams of quadrotors because the complex aerodynamic wake interactions can destabilize individual team members as well as the team. Furthermore, these aerodynamic effects are highly nonlinear and fast-paced, making them difficult to model and predict. To overcome these challenges, we present L1 KNODE-DW MPC, an adaptive, mixed expert learning based control framework that allows individual quadrotors to accurately track trajectories while adapting to time-varying aerodynamic interactions during formation flights. We evaluate L1 KNODE-DW MPC in two different three-quadrotor formations and show that it outperforms several MPC baselines. Our results show that the proposed framework is capable of enabling the three-quadrotor team to remain vertically aligned in close proximity throughout the flight. These findings show that the L1 adaptive module compensates for unmodeled disturbances most effectively when paired with an accurate dynamics model.},

  title={Flying Quadrotors in Tight Formations using Learning-based Model Predictive Control},
  author={Chee*, Kong Yao and  Hsieh*, Pei-An and Pappas, George J. and Hsieh, M. Ani},
  abstract={Flying quadrotors in tight formations is a challenging problem. It is known that in the near-field airflow of a quadrotor, the aerodynamic effects induced by the propellers are complex and difficult to characterize. Although machine learning tools can potentially be used to derive models that capture these effects, these data-driven approaches can be sample inefficient and the resulting models often do not generalize as well as their first-principles counterparts. In this work, we propose a framework that combines the benefits of first-principles modeling and data-driven approaches to construct an accurate and sample efficient representation of the complex aerodynamic effects resulting from quadrotors flying in formation. The data-driven component within our model is lightweight, making it amenable for optimization-based control design. Through simulations and physical experiments, we show that incorporating the model into a novel learning-based nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework results in substantial performance improvements in terms of trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection. In particular, our framework significantly outperforms nominal MPC in physical experiments, achieving a 40.1% improvement in the average trajectory tracking errors and a 57.5% reduction in the maximum vertical separation errors. Our framework also achieves exceptional sample efficiency, using only a total of 46 seconds of flight data for training across both simulations and physical experiments. Furthermore, with our proposed framework, the quadrotors achieve an exceptionally tight formation, flying with an average separation of less than 1.5 body lengths throughout the flight.},

  abstract={In this study, the infant Cardiac Robotic Surgical
System (iCROSS) is developed to assist a surgeon in performing
the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure and other infant
cardiac surgeries. The iCROSS is a dual-arm robot allowing
two surgical instruments to collaborate in a narrow space while
keeping a sufficiently large workspace. Compared with the
existing surgical robotic systems, the iCROSS meets the specific
requirements of infant cardiac surgeries. Its feasibility has
been validated through several teleoperated tasks performed in
the experiment. In particular, the iCROSS is able to perform
surgical ligation successfully within one minute.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
