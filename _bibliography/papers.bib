  abstract={In this study, the infant Cardiac Robotic Surgical
System (iCROSS) is developed to assist a surgeon in performing
the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure and other infant
cardiac surgeries. The iCROSS is a dual-arm robot allowing
two surgical instruments to collaborate in a narrow space while
keeping a sufficiently large workspace. Compared with the
existing surgical robotic systems, the iCROSS meets the specific
requirements of infant cardiac surgeries. Its feasibility has
been validated through several teleoperated tasks performed in
the experiment. In particular, the iCROSS is able to perform
surgical ligation successfully within one minute.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
