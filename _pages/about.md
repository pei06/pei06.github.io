I am Pei-An Hsieh, an incoming Ph.D. student at the GRASP Lab. My research focuses on developing trustworthy, data-driven control strategies for robots. My previous work explored learning-based MPC, uncertainty quantification, and adaptive control. It has been an exciting journey, and I aim to further leverage the accurate reasoning of neural networks to achieve precise robot control while ensuring performance and safety guarantees. My dream is to enable robots to safely assist humans in everyday life. Outside of research, I enjoy playing the violin, practicing calligraphy, and playing soccer.
