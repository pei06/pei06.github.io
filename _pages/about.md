I am Pei-An Hsieh, a first-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. M. Ani Hsieh at the GRASP Lab. My research focuses on developing trustworthy, data-driven control strategies for multi-robot systems. My previous work has explored learning-based model predictive control (MPC), uncertainty quantification, and adaptive control. It has been an exciting journey, and I aim to further harness the reasoning capabilities of neural networks to achieve precise robot control with strong performance and safety guarantees. My long-term goal is to enable robots to safely and efficiently collaborate in real-world environments. Outside of research, I enjoy playing the violin, practicing calligraphy, and playing soccer.
