I am Pei-An Hsieh, currently a Student Researcher at NASA Lab, National Taiwan University and MacLab, UCLA. I am applying for M.S. in Robotics and CS for Fall 2023. My research interest mainly lies in developing and implementing human-robot interaction(HRI) algorithms, including healthcare and medical robotics, autonomous manipulation, collision avoidance, and navigation.


The project that I am currently working on is the development of a software structure integrating Qt and Ethercat to control motors.
