I am Pei-An Hsieh, a researcher at NASA Lab, National Taiwan University, and MacLab, UCLA. I will be attending Penn for Robotics MSE in fall 2023. My research interest is developing and implementing robotics algorithms, including motion planning, collision avoidance, and navigation.


The project that I am currently working on is the development of a software structure integrating Qt and Ethercat to control motors.
